# üìö Personal Academic Website

This repository hosts my **personal blog and academic portfolio**, built using the [**Academic Pages**](https://academicpages.github.io/) template ‚Äî a modern, customizable Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages.

> Academic Pages is designed for researchers, students, and professionals to showcase their publications, projects, and achievements.
