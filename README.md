# 📚 Personal Academic Website

This repository hosts my **personal blog and academic portfolio**, built using the [**Academic Pages**](https://academicpages.github.io/) template — a modern, customizable Jekyll theme for GitHub Pages.

> Academic Pages is designed for researchers, students, and professionals to showcase their publications, projects, and achievements.

## 🚀 Getting Started

To set up your own site using this template:

1. **Sign up or log in** to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and verify your email.
2. Go to the [Academic Pages GitHub repo](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).
3. Click **“Use this template”** (top-right) to create your own copy.
4. Name the repo:
   ➤ `your-username.github.io`
   This will become your website’s URL:
   ➤ `https://your-username.github.io`
5. Customize your site content and `_config.yml` settings.
6. Add files (e.g., PDFs) to the `files/` directory. Access them at:
   ➤ `https://your-username.github.io/files/example.pdf`
7. To check publishing status, go to **Settings → Pages** in your repo.
8. *(Optional)* Use the Python/Jupyter tools in the `markdown_generator/` folder to generate publication pages from TSV files.
