Hi! I'm originally from [Côte d'Ivoire](https://tourismecotedivoire.ci/). Life hasn't always been easy — I’ve had to hustle my way through with little financial support, but that only made me hungrier for success.

I've always had a deep love for mathematics and a versatile spirit, driven by the ambition to be excellent at everything I do. At 19, I got my first computer — and it was a game changer. I fell in love instantly.

That spark pushed me to shift focus from pure mathematics to computer science, driven by a need to close the knowledge gap and grow into a well-rounded developer.

Thanks to my scientific background, versatility, and commitment to excellence, I've been able to contribute to a variety of projects — from personal experiments to helping friends, relatives, and professional work.

This website is my way of showcasing all that I’ve built and continue to build. Welcome to my world.
