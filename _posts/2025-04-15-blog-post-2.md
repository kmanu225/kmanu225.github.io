If youâ€™ve ever created an RSA-based SSH key, you might have been surprised by the size of the key it generated. Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC), on the other hand, offers much shorter keys while maintaining the same level of security. Since its introduction, ECC has steadily gained popularity and has increasingly replaced RSA for both confidentiality (encryption) and non-repudiation (digital signatures). 
**This is the first post in a series** on Elliptic Curve Cryptography.
